# Murmur

Murmur is a proof-of-concept app that brings the power of [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) to the Mac.

The goal is to create a native macOS application that provides a user-friendly interface for Whisper, Apple's own on-device transcription, and other systems. This allows journalists to transcribe interviews on their own device if they don't feel they can trust or pay for services like Otter.ai and Rev.
